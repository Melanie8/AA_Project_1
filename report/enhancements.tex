\section{Local Optimization}

After having implemented the four above heuristics, we tried to implement some local optimization methods. These methods take a given tour and try to enhance it. Three main techniques are commonly used : 2-opt, 3-opt and Lin-Kernighan.

\subsection{2-opt}
 The idea of 2-opt is to try to exchange all the pairs of edges (see example in Figure~\ref{2-opt}). In the implementation of this method, we have to be careful to the direct
